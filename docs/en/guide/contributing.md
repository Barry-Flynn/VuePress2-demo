# Contributing

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to `BFUI`. Please spend several minutes reading these guidelines before you create an issue or pull request.

## Code of Conduct

We have adopted a [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md) that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Open Development

All work on Ant Design happens directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/Barry-Flynn/BFUI). Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

## Branch Organization

As this project is just starting, we do not have a fixed release cycle at present, but we will maintain two branch `masters` and `features` for a long time.

- If you want to fix a bug, please send a pull request to the `master`, and we will release a patch version from the master from time to time;

- If you want to propose a pull request to add new functions, please do it based on the `feature` branch. We will irregularly merge features to the master and release a minor version containing new features.

## Bugs

We are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Barry-Flynn/BFUI/issues) for bug tracking.

Before you report a bug, please make sure you've searched existing issues, and read our [FAQ](./faq.md).

## Proposing a Change

If you intend to change the public API or introduce new feature, you are welcome to create a new issue to add new functions.

If you want to help on new API, please reference [API Naming Rules](./api-naming-rules.md) to name it.
