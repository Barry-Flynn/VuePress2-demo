## What is BFUI?

BFUI, A Growing `Front-end Development Toolbox`.

BFUI is currently positioned as a tool to simplify some front-end development work. Developers can use some encapsulated JavaScript `tool functions` or `components` by simply importing files. It can help developers simplify the implementation steps in the coding process, improve development efficiency and save development time. It frees design and R&D from repetitive work in an elegant and efficient way, and facilitates customized expansion on this basis to better meet business needs.

Admittedly, it may still be crude at present, and its help in actual development is also very limited. However, Rome was not built in a day. Every new idea will grow from its birth to its maturity. It's my honor that you may witness the growth of BFUI with me, or if you are interested, you can participate in the growth of BFUI, which will definitely be an interesting experience. Blablabla...

## Differences from other projects

### 1. Different design concepts

We are more in pursuit of `simple style`, `easy use`, `strong customization` and other characteristics.

### 2. Will be more powerful

We will pay close attention to the function functions or utility components that are missing from other JavaScript toolsets or component libraries, but are often used in the actual development process.

Therefore, BFUI is not only a `UI component library`, but also has many built-in utility `tool functions` to simplify page development efficiency as much as possible. So we prefer to call it **A Growing Front-end Development Toolbox**.
